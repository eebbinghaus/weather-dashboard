# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Use this weather dashboard to search cities around the world and display relevant weather data for those cities. This dashboard displays the current weather as well as a 5-Day Forecast to keep you updated with the weather changes throughout the week. The dashboard will save the cities that you've searched and store them in a button on the side of the page. This is great for planning trips as it allows you to access the weather in different cities very quickly. The data displayed includes an icon representing the weather conditions as well as the temperature, the wind speed, and also the humidity.
